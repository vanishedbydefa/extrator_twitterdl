# Auto extractor for Twitter Media Downloader
Note: The twitter media downloader does not work anymore. This repository is now useless :(

With this script you will never have to extract all those downloaded zip files manually.
Just enter the path to the zips and see them get organized.

The script works with zips downloaded from: https://github.com/furyutei/twMediaDownloader
